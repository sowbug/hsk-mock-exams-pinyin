# HSK Mock Exams in Pinyin

For English-speaking learners of Mandarin who are studying for the
[HSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi) exam and
are still in the early levels, it can be difficult to study the
transcription of the [HSK mock
exams'](https://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/hsk/hskmaterials.php)
listening sections because they're provided in Hanzi rather than
Pinyin, and it's likely that beginner students are studying Pinyin
rather than Hanzi. To help such students, these documents present
three versions of the listening sections:

1. The original Hanzi, copied directly from the mock exams' answer
sections

2. A Pinyin version, courtesy of [Google
Translate](https://translate.google.com/)

3. An English version, also from Google Translate

This process worked for me while studying:

1. Print out the original mock exam and take it, using the mock exam's
audio file.

3. Grade the exam using the answers at the end of the mock exam.

4. Review the incorrect answers, trying to figure out the mistake.

5. Listen to the exam's audio file once again, but reading along with
the Pinyin version.

6. Consult the English version if things still aren't clear.

Sometimes the English translation is bad because it's
machine-generated by Google Translate and doesn't always do a perfect
job. File issues if you see problems worth correcting, and I'll be
happy to regenerate the PDFs.

Good luck with your studies.
